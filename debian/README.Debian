Debian README for lltag package
===============================

lltag recommends mp3info, vorbis-tools and flac Debian packages.
It does not _depend_ on these packages since you might want
to tag mp3 files without having to install vorbis-tools or flac.

If tagging fails saying that mp3info, vorbiscomment or metaflac
command does not exist, you should install the required package.
