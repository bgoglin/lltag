Debian README for lltag package
===============================

lltag recommends mp3info and vorbis-tools Debian packages.
It does not _depend_ on these packages since you might want
to tag mp3 files without having to install vorbis-tools.

If tagging fails saying that mp3info or vorbiscomment command
does not exist, you should install the required package.
