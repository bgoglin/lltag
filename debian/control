Description: Automatic command-line mp3/ogg/flac file tagger and renamer
 lltag is a command-line tool manipulating MP3 ID3, OGG or FLAC tags.
 It may be used to tag multiples files at once by comparing their filename
 or pathname against a configurable list of formats, or by getting tags
 from the CDDB database.
 .
 lltag may also rename files according to a configurable filename format.
 The interface has been designed to be as automatic, efficient and smart
 as possible.
