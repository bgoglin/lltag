  * CDDB now uses TrackType.org instead of freedb.org since the HTTP search
    interface of freedb.org is unavailable for now (closes Hamish Moffatt's
    Debian bug #397626). TrackType.org is the old freedb2.org, its database
    might not be as complete as the others, but at least it works and is
    very convenient to use.
  * Fix --clear.
  * Fix of --append, especially because handling of multiple values for the
    same tag was very broken.
  * Fix processing of additional tags (passed with --tag), especially in
    case of multiple values for the same tag.
  * Improve the main description at the beginning of the manpage.
  * Rewrite HTTP requests using libwww-perl.
    + Drop --cddb-proxy and use the HTTP_PROXY variable in the
      environment (set it to something like "http://my.proxy.com").
    + libwww-perl (LWP) is now recommended since required for CDDB access.
  * Change the backend API to manipulate hash of values instead of talking
    to external programs, to help upcoming backends.
    - Conversion from hash to external programs (command line and output
      stream) is moved to new helper functions for backends that need them.
  * When tags have multiple value, do not have the same value twice.
  * When --tag is passed, disable -G by default.
  * Add "files..." to the synopsis in the manpage since lltag only operates
    on files that are given on the command line (not on the whole directory)
    and add a message in verbose mode when no files are given
    (reported by Hamish Moffatt in Debian bug #397627).
  * Reorganize the CDDB code to make it easy to use other online CDDB site,
    using kind of a backend interface.
  * Add the configuration file option name near the corresponding command
    line option in the manpage.
  * Add a note in the manpage, near -g, about the fact that the genre string
    might have to match within a list of specified genres.
  * Some fixes in the manpage.
  * Add missing options in the comments in the config file.
  * Improve requirements in the README.


lltag (0.12.2)

  * Fix %i processing (was broken since 0.12).
  * Fix regexp application.
  * Update the How-to about automatic CDDB and --cddb-query.
  * Improve error messaging.
  * Improve messaging in automatic mode.
  * Cleanup Perl regexps.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Mon, 23 Oct 2006 13:38:00 +0200

lltag (0.12.1)

  * Improve automatization of CDDB:
    + Add --cddb-query to search in CDDB automatically from the
      command-line with either keywords or category/id.
    + Add 'a' and '<index> a' to switch to automatic CDDB mode
      while interactively choosing a track in a CD.
    + Fix automization of CDDB with --yes.
  * When using 'a' to switch to automatic mode, only change the mode
    for the local menu (i.e. automatic parsing does not make automatic
    tagging or CDDB usage).
  * If CDDB query by keywords finds nothing, go back to keywords query
    instead of asking the user to choose in the (empty) list.
  * Add %F, %E and %P to be replaced by original basename, extension
    and path of the file when renaming.
  * Add --type to make file type selection more flexible.
  * Use DELETE or <DELETE> to erase a tag when editing.
  * Add a easy-to-use backend interface to help adding support for
    other file types.
    + Backend information (registrations and failures) are displayed
      in verbose mode -v).
  * Fix Perl modularization, no need to use Exporter module since we
    access modular functions by prefixing with the module name.
  * Improve some messages.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Tue, 03 Oct 2006 16:22:00 +0200

lltag (0.12)

  * Add CDDB support with -C or --cddb (or C in the main menu):
    + Search CD ids by keywords, with ability to choose categories
      and fields to look in.
    + Lookup a CD by giving its category and CD id directly.
    + Keep the previous CD contents in memory so that the next track
      might be tagged immediately.
    + Edit CDDB common tags before extracting a track from a CD.
    + Configurable HTTP CDDB server and proxy.
  * Rework interactive menus to integrate CDDB better:
    + Add a main menu from where CDDB, parsing and editing is called.
    + Use 'q' to leave submenus (parsing, CDDB, renaming and editing).
    + Use 'q' instead of 's' to skip a file from the main menu.
    + Use 'y' to exit editing after save the changes.
    + Add 'Q' to exit completely.
    + Do not match user replies case-insensitively.
    + Large rework of the manpage to document the new menus.
  * Some new entries in the How-To.
  * Do not write guess option in the generated configuration file
    unless explicitely asked by the user.
  * Add a doc/ subdirectory:
    + The How-To is now also included in the tarball.
  * Perl modularization.
  * Add the date to the program name when compiling it from SVN.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Tue, 19 Sep 2006 21:34:00 -0400

lltag (0.11)

  * Always read existing tags first, allowing to:
    + Rename using existing tags when the old filename is useless
      (requested by Fabien Wernli). In case of multiple occurence of a tag,
      the first one is used.
    + Suppport replacing, clearing, and appending well for all types:
      - Replacing is now the default for all types.
      - Appending is useless for mp3 since only one occurence (the first one)
        may be stored in the file.
      - Remove the CLEARING, REPLACING OR APPENDING manpage section.
  * Add --tag for additional tags, and warn when not storable in in mp3 files.
  * Now use %d, -d and DATE instead of %y, -y and YEAR since ogg/flac tags
    are dates.
  * Use %i instead of %d to ignore some text when matching.
  * Fix 'u' confirmation to try the current parser first for next files
    (was broken since 0.10).
  * 'basename' is now used instead of 'filename' for 'type' in the format
    file, 'filename' is still supported for now.
  * Do not rename if the new name already exists.
  * Fix reading/tagging the date of ogg/flac files.
  * Use all-capitals tag names to match ogg/flac.
    + default_<non-capitalized-name> option is still supported in the config
      for now.
  * The indices in the format file may now be full field names instead of
    letters.
  * Print the default letter in <> instead of capital when confirming/editing.
  * Add EDITING TAGS in the manpage.
  * Add configuration options for the config file in the manpage.
  * Fix quoting of the command-line in --dry-run.
  * Large rework of the internal structures.
  * Major cleanup of the manpage.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sat, 19 Mar 2006 23:56:00 -0500

lltag (0.10)

  * Use Readline library to make tag editing easier if the installed
    readline library is smart, with inline edition of existing tags
    and history of last entered values.
  * Added -S ans --show-tags to only show file tags instead of tagging
    (requested by Stephane Gimenez in Gna! bug #4601).
  * Add --regexp and --rename-regexp for basic regexp-replacing in tags
    (requested by Jonathan Worth Washington, Gna! bug #4604).
  * When renaming with a undefined track number, initialize it to 0.
  * When renaming with a track number, make it at least 2 digits
    (reported by Emmanuel Jeandel).
  * Always write renaming configuration options with --gencfg, even
    if renaming was not enabled.
  * Cleanup core function names and several messages so that lltag speak
    about matching instead of tagging. It avoids getting messages about
    tagging while --no-tagging was passed (requested by Stephane Gimenez).
  * Use ' instead of # to show spaces between command line argument
    with --dry-run (requested by Emmanuel Jeandel).
  * Allow to pass ()[] characters in the matching format without having
    to escape them.
  * Allow all %x in the renaming format when x is not a field letter.
  * Fix where the 'd' field (dummy) is allowed.
  * Fix the error when no formats file is found.
  * Fix typos in the manpage (reported by Emmanuel Jeandel).

lltag (0.9.1)

    + Fix formats file parsing (last format was omitted).
    + If $HOME/.lltag/formats exists, /etc/lltag/formats is ignored.
    + Fix documentation.
  * Add --config, --gencfg and /etc/lltag/config to configure lltag behavior
    (requested by Stephane Gimenez).
  * Do not warn when no file is passed.
