lltag installation instructions
===============================

You don't care about this if you use Debian or Gentoo prepackaged
versions that are available on http://bgoglin.free.fr/lltag

Run 'make install' as root.

By default, everything is installed in /usr/local/.
Most directories might be replaced by overriding their default values
on the command line.
For instance, a traditional installation might be achieved with
 make install PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man

Note that 'make uninstall' (with same options) allows to uninstall.

lltag requirements
==================

lltag theoretically only requires Perl base to work. However, depending
on what type of files you want to work on, you'll need to install either
mp3info (for MP3 files), vorbiscomment (for OGG) or metaflac (for FLAC).
Additionaly, when using CDDB features, LWP (the libwww-perl module) is
required.
These dependencies are automatically installed when installing
Debian or Gentoo prepackaged versions, or at least recommended.

lltag may also benefit from a smart readline perl library when
the user edits the tags by hand.
The recommended library is Term::ReadLine::Gnu (also called
GNU Readline Library Wrapper Module) which provides great
inline editing and GNU history features.
Term::ReadLine::Perl may also be used but it might not be able
to save the history between two lltag invocation.
