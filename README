lltag installation instructions
===============================

You don't care about this if you use Debian or Gentoo prepackaged
versions that are available on http://bgoglin.free.fr/lltag

Run 'make install' as root.

By default, everything is installed in /usr/local/.
Most directories might be replaced by overriding their default values
on the command line.
For instance, a traditional installation might be achieved with
 make install PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man

Note that 'make uninstall' (with same options) allows to uninstall.

lltag requirements
==================

lltag theoretically only requires Perl base to work. However, depending
on what type of files you want to work on, you'll need to install
either the Perl MP3::Tag module (for MP3 files) or mp3info (for MP3 files,
without ID3v2 support), vorbiscomment (for OGG) or metaflac (for FLAC).
Additionally, when using CDDB features, LWP (the libwww-perl module) is
required.
These dependencies are automatically installed when installing
Debian or Gentoo prepackaged versions, or at least recommended.

lltag may also benefit from a smart readline perl library when
the user edits the tags by hand.
The recommended library is Term::ReadLine::Gnu (also called
GNU Readline Library Wrapper Module) which provides great
inline editing and GNU history features.
Term::ReadLine::Perl may also be used but it might not be able
to save the history between two lltag invocation.
