lltag is a frontend to tag (and rename) mp3/ogg/flac files automagically.

See http://bgoglin.free.fr/lltag/ for details.

lltag installation instructions
===============================

You don't care about this if you use Debian or Gentoo or any other
distribution that includes prepackaged lltag versions.

Run 'make' followed by 'make install' as root.
*Both* command-lines must use the same variables for configuring
installation paths.

By default, everything is installed in /usr/local/.
Most directories might be changed by overriding their default values
on the command-line.
For instance, a traditional installation (binary in /usr/bin, data in
/usr/share, and configuration in /etc) might be achieved with:

$ make PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man
$ make install PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man

If you don't want or can't install as root, you may use
$ make PREFIX=/home/login/where/you/want
$ make install PREFIX=/home/login/where/you/want

Note that 'make uninstall' (with same options) allows to uninstall.

lltag requirements
==================

lltag theoretically only requires Perl base to work. However, depending
on what type of files you want to work on, you'll need to install
either the Perl MP3::Tag module (for MP3 files) or mp3info (for MP3 files,
without ID3v2 support), vorbiscomment (for OGG) or metaflac (for FLAC).
Additionally, when using CDDB features, LWP (the libwww-perl module) is
required.
These dependencies are automatically installed when installing
Debian or Gentoo prepackaged versions, or at least recommended.

lltag may also benefit from a smart readline perl library when
the user edits the tags by hand.
The recommended library is Term::ReadLine::Gnu (also called
GNU Readline Library Wrapper Module) which provides great
inline editing and GNU history features.
Term::ReadLine::Perl may also be used but it might not be able
to save the history between two lltag invocation.
