lltag installation instructions
===============================

You don't care about this if you use Debian or Gentoo prepackaged
versions that are available on http://bgoglin.free.fr/lltag

Run 'make install' as root.

By default, everything is installed in /usr/local/.
Most directories might be replaced by overriding their default values
on the command line.
For instance, a traditional installation might be achieved with
 make install PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man

Note that 'make uninstall' (with same options) allows to uninstall.

lltag requirements
==================

lltag requires perl, vorbis-tools and mp3info.
These dependencies are automatically installed when installing
Debian or Gentoo prepackaged versions.
