.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lltag
is a command-line tool to automagically set tags of
MP3, OGG or FLAC files.
It parses the filenames according different formats
to get the tags.
The formats may be either given by the user or guessed
by
.B lltag
from its internal database.

When called with the
.B \-F
option (once or multiple times), it will first try
the user-specified formats.

Internal formats will be tried later if the
.B \-G
option was passed.

\fImp3info\fR is used to tag MP3 files
while \fIvorbiscomment\fR is used for OGG files,
and \fImetaflac\fR is used for FLAC files.

When called with
.B \-\-rename
the target file will also be renamed.

.SH FORMAT
User-specified formats must be a string composed of any characters
and the following special codes:
.RS

.I "%a"
to match the author.

.I "%A"
to match the album.

.I "%g"
to match the genre.

.I "%n"
to match the track number.

.I "%t"
to match the title.

.I "%y"
to match the year.

.I "%c"
to match the comment.

.I "%d"
to match anything and forget it.

.I "%%"
to match %.



.SH CLEARING, REPLACING OR APPENDING
Id3 tags of mp3 files are a set of 7 independent fields,
while ogg/flac tags is a unique stream of one field per line.
That is why mp3 tags may be changed independently while
ogg/flac tags may be reset or appended.

Thus,
.IR lltag
clears ogg tag by default before setting the new ones,
while it only replaces mp3 tags.

.IR lltag
may either replace (by default), append or reset flac tags since
.I metaflac
is flexible enough to do so.

If
.I \-\-clear
is passed, all mp3/flac tags will be cleared first.
This does not impact ogg tagging since it clears by default.

If
.I \-\-append
is passed, ogg/flac tags are appended to the existing ones.
This does not impact mp3 tagging since appending is impossible
(newly-defined existing tags are replaced, others are kept).



.SH TAGGING CONFIRMATION
When
.I \-\-ask
is passed or when guessing, each matching will lead to
a confirmation message before tagging.
Available behaviors are:

.B y
.RS
Tag current file with current format.
.RE

.B v
.RS
View which tags would be set.
.RE

.B u
.RS
Tag current file with current format.
Then use current format for all remaining matching files.
When a non-matching file is reached, stop using this
preferred format.
.RE

.B a
.RS
Tag current file with current format.
Then, never asking for a confirmation anymore.
.RE

.B e
.RS
Edit current fields before tagging, including fields
that are non matched by the format, and default values.
Editing ends by tagging or canceling (return to confirmation menu).
The current value, if defined, is shown in parenthesis.
Pressing
.BI <enter>
will keep this value.
Entering
.BI CLEAR
will empty it.
.RE

.B n
.RS
Don't tag current file with this format.
Try the next matching format on the current file.
.RE

.B p
.RS
When matching is done through combination of a path parser
and a filename parser, keep the filename parser and try the
next path parser on the current file.
.RE

.B s
.RS
Skip the current file, don't tag it at all.
.RE

.B h
.RS
Show help about confirmation.
.RE



.SH RENAMING CONFIRMATION
By default, before renaming, a confirmation is asked to the user.
You may bypass it by passing
.I \-\-yes
on the command line.

If the rename format uses a field that is not defined,
a warning is shown and confirmation is always asked.

Available behaviors when renaming are:

.B y
.RS
Rename current file with current new filename.
.RE

.B a
.RS
Rename current file with current new filename.
Then, never asking for a renaming confirmation anymore.
.RE

.B e
.RS
Edit current new filename before renaming.
.RE

.B n
.RS
Don't rename current file.
.RE

.B h
.RS
Show help about confirmation.
.RE



.SH INTERNAL FORMATS
The internal format database is usually stored in
.IR "/etc/lltag/formats" .
The user may override this file by defining a
.IR "$HOME/.lltag/formats" .
If this file exists, the system-wide one is ignored.

These files contain entries composed of :

.RE
.I [%n - %a - %t]
.RS
A title between bracket
.RE
.I type = filename
.RS
The type is either
.IR filename
or
.IR "path"
.RE
.I regexp = %L%N%S-%S%A%S-%S%A%L
.RS
A format composed of %L for limiting space, %N for numbers, %S for a space,
%A for anything (except /), %P for any path and %% for %.
.RE
.I indices = n,a,t
.RS
A list of format letters corresponding to %N or %A field in the previous format
(See
.SM
.B FORMAT
for a list of these letters).



.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.IR lltag
reads some configuration files before parsing command line options.
The system-wide configuration file is defined in
.I /etc/lltag/config
where all options are documented.

It also reads
.I $HOME/.lltag/config
if it exists.

The user may also add another configurable file with
.I --config .

.IR lltag
may also generate a configuration with
.I --gencfg .



.SH FILES
.RE
.I /etc/lltag/formats
.RS
System-wide internal format database.
See
.SM
.B INTERNAL FORMATS
for details.
.RE
.I $HOME/.lltag/formats
.RS
User internal format database. If it exists, the system-wide one is ignored.
.RE
.I /etc/lltag/config
.RS
System-wide configuration file, with documentation.
See
.SM
.B CONFIGURATION FILES
for details.
.RE
.I $HOME/.lltag/config
.RS
User configuration file.
